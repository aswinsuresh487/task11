# Task 11: CSS Hover Effect and JavaScript Fix

This repository demonstrates a CSS image hover effect and a JavaScript-based solution to a common issue with it.

## Contents

-   `index_css.html`: An HTML file that contains an image that disappears when you hover over it. This is achieved using only CSS.
-   `index_js.html`: An HTML file that fixes the issue from the CSS-only version. The image disappears on hover and reappears when the mouse leaves the image area, using JavaScript.

## How to Use

You can open both `index_css.html` and `index_js.html` in any web browser to see the effects.

-   **`index_css.html`**: Hover over the image to see it disappear.
-   **`index_js.html`**: Hover over the image to see it disappear, and move the mouse away to see it reappear.
